    <h3><u>Description</u></h3>
    <p>Pizza is a beloved Italian creation, typically built on a thin, round dough base topped with tomato sauce, cheese, and a
    variety of toppings. Traditional varieties, like Margherita, use simple ingredients like mozzarella, fresh basil, and
    olive oil, while others may include an array of vegetables, meats, or even seafood. The versatility of pizza allows for
    endless experimentation with flavors and toppings.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pizza dough (flour, yeast, water, salt, olive oil)</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce (or crushed tomatoes)</li>
        <li>Fresh mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Crushed red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven: Heat your oven to its highest setting (typically 250-260°C or 475-500°F). If you have a pizza stone,
        place it in the oven to heat.</li>
        <li>Prepare the dough: Roll out your pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness.</li>
        <li>Add sauce: Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce on the dough, leaving a small border around the edges for the crust.</li>
        <li>Add toppings: Tear fresh mozzarella into chunks and distribute evenly over the sauce. Add fresh basil leaves.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza: Transfer the pizza to the hot pizza stone or baking sheet and bake for 8-10 minutes, until the crust is
        golden and the cheese is bubbling.</li>
        <li>Finish and serve: Drizzle a little olive oil on top, slice, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
